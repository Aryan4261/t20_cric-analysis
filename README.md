# t20_cric-analysis

Created a Power BI report to identify the top 11 players for a T20 cricket team by scrapping data from ESPN Cricinfo with 
Bright data website tool, cleaning and transforming the data with pandas, and evaluating various player performance 
metrics.

Used the resulting Power BI dashboard to select players for various categories (openers, middle order/anchors, finishers, 
all-rounders, specialist fast bowlers) and ultimately choose the top 11 players to play in the match.

Selected teams using the Power BI dashboard have a 90% chance of winning the game.
